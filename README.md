#Amazon Sales Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, aimed at analyzing sales performance, product trends, and customer engagement metrics. The objective of the project is to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that can support data-driven business decisions.

The dataset was cleaned and modeled to create a structured analytical layer. A dedicated Date Table was created using DAX and marked as a date table to enable accurate time-intelligence analysis. Using this date dimension, key performance metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales, Products Sold, and Reviews were calculated.

The dashboard focuses on tracking overall sales trends over time, understanding category-wise and product-wise performance, and analyzing customer reviews as a measure of engagement. Interactive visuals, slicers, and KPIs were designed to allow users to dynamically explore the data and identify patterns, seasonal trends, and high-performing product categories.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design, making it suitable for real-world business analysis and entry-level data analyst roles.
